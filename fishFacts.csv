Fish sure do exist!
Did you know that the average fish weighs almost as much as two football fields?
"There are currently 144,742 articles containing the word ""fish"" on Wikipedia!"
"Follow your heart, be a fish"
"women want me, fish fear me."
"The average blue whale produces 50 gallons of sperm, but only 10% actually makes it into the female. So if you ever wonder why the ocean is salty, this is why."
Fish are *always* thirsty.
"Hey guys, did you know that in terms of male human and female Pokémon breeding, Vaporeon is the most compatible Pokémon for humans? Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3""03' tall and 63.9 pounds, this means they're large enough to be able handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base Stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based biology, there's no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll Eyes, Captivate, Charm, and Tail Whip, along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it'd be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough water. No other Pokémon comes close to this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white. Vaporeon is literally built for human dick. Ungodly defense stat+high
HP pool+Acid Armor means it can take cock all day, all shapes and sizes and still come for more"
No fish has ever won a triathlon.

"Fish have no natural predators, except for God."
"if your video game doesn't have fishing, it's not actually a video game, it's a waste of computer storage"
It's at least a C+!
